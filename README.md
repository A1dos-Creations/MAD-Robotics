## üõ†Ô∏è **Creating the Armbotic‚Ñ¢**
What goes into making the Armbotic‚Ñ¢ modules?

Because our company is run by two high-schoolers, Armbotic‚Ñ¢ units take a while to manufacture. Making one Armbotic‚Ñ¢ unit can take up to 1 month. We purchase everything from trusted sellers, such as Newegg, Arduino, RaspberryPi, and other notable sellers. For our prototypes/proof of concept units, we are using a RasperryPi and Arduino to control the unit. In the future, we will develop a custom board *(PCB)* that suits our robots beter.

## Are we a business?
No, we are **not** a business, but we do trademark our names and will create an LLC plus register our trademarks in the near future.

## üí∞ Money
Because we are two high-school students, we have a very limited ammount of money, for that reason, we rely heavily on crowdfunding and donations. Please consider donating [here](https://paypal.me/a1dos?country.x=US&locale.x=en_US) if you want to be a part of the founding sponsors! ‚ù§Ô∏è *(A1dos Creations)*
